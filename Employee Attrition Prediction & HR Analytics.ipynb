    "\n",
    "This project is an opportunity for me to analyze an HR dataset and build predictive models that provide meaningful insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. My goal is to develop a model that predicts whether or not an employee is likely to leave the organization, which can help HR improve employee retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing this project, I will produce two final deliverables that I can present to future employers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A one-page summary report that presents the key findings and insights for external stakeholders, written from the perspective of a data professional working at Salifort Motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A complete code notebook, including all data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, evaluation, visualizations, and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the modeling approach, I will choose one method either a regression model or a machine learning classification model to predict employee attrition. Although example solutions may show both approaches, I will select and complete only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My deliverables will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model evaluation results and interpretation \n",
    "\n",
    "At least one meaningful data visualization directly related to my research question\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical considerations regarding data usage and modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of resources I used to troubleshoot issues and guide development"
